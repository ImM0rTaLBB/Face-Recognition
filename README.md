# Python Face Recognition.

This is my personal project during the time I was working in the logistics company.
The goal of this project is to test out my ability to try to use python and face recognition library to identify the face and name of the person.
In which the next plan of this project was to implement an attendance system using the high definition camera to capture the face of the employee
and record the time arrival to the office in the Google Sheets for HR.
